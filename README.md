# Use a pipeline as a high-level helper
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B")




# Load model directly
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B")


# Problem Statement:

Retail and e-commerce businesses face significant challenges in delivering personalized customer experiences while optimizing operational efficiency. The key issues include accurately anticipating customer needs, making relevant product recommendations, forecasting demand, and optimizing pricing strategies in real-time.
